### Description

Fixed the UI problem. Easier on the eyes.

What does DDSCL_ALLOWMODEX do? <br>

What does DDSD_CAPS mean? <br>

This will help you to understand what everything does and what everything means. It also has a built in demo showing you how to blit, draw text, and figure FPS, agian fully commented to help you understand. I want to make more of these cause it also helps me to learn but if no one likes them I wont. Please let me know what you think and maybe I'll make a bigger tutorial and do a tutorial on what you guys want, Direct3D, DirectMusic, DirectSound, etc. Due to filesize and until I get my cable modem, this one is relatively short, but VERY HELPFULL. Let me know what you think of it. Enjoy -James-
